### Browser Compatibility

*   The website has been tested on these following broswes:
    * Google Chrome Version 110.0.5481.178 (Official Build) (64-bit)
    * Mozilla Firefox Version 110.0.1 (64-bit)
    * Microsoft Edge Version 110.0.1587.57 (Official build) (64-bit)
    * Apple Safari on macOS Ventura Version 16.3 (18614.4.6.1.6)
    * Apple Safari on iOS 16.0 (20A362)
    * DuckDuckGo Mobile Version 7.72.2.0

### Accessibility

* [WebAIM - Contrast Checker:](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) was utilised during the design process to determine if the colour scheme would work in terms of readability and accessibility. 
    * Since the colour scheme was selected by the client in order to represent their business, there was some issues with readability and accessibility.
    * The colour #F4D455 was too light, so a darker shade #FFB30F was chosen instead.
    * To make the text more readable, the colour #FFFFFF and #4D4D4D was used when appropriate. 

* [Am I Responsive:](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) was utilised to check if the website is responsive across different viewports.

* [Chrome DevTools:](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) was also utilised to check if the website is responsive across different viewports.
